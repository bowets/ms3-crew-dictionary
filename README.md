# ms3-crew-dictionary
Cruise Ship Crew have their own language and as part of my Milestone 3 project I'm creating a dictionary of ship related terms and crew language.

Since working on a cruise ship I tried to find a resource where I can remember the words and terminology I used onboard with my fellow crew memebers. As we all know, any language that is not used is lost. I did not want to lose this language so I developed a dictionary where I can store all the words I used while working on ships. 
I also hope to release this website once it is graded for the milestone project and after a few more fixes which need to be done and those are referenced in the readme below.

This is a dictionary and the main focus are the words and definitions submitted by users. For this reason, the landing page is allows anyone, whether registered or unregistered can browse the list of words in the dictionary.
