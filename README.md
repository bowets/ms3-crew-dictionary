# ms3-crew-dictionary
Cruise Ship Crew have their own language and as part of my Milestone 3 project I'm creating a dictionary of ship related terms and crew language.

Since working on a cruise ship I tried to find a resource where I can remember the words and terminology I used onboard with my fellow crew memebers. As we all know, any language that is not used is lost. I did not want to lose this language so I developed a dictionary where I can store all the words I used while working on ships. 
I also hope to release this website once it is graded for the milestone project and after a few more fixes which need to be done and those are referenced in the readme below. 

#UX
This is a dictionary and the main focus are the words and definitions submitted by users.
