      <h1 class="mb-5">About Cruise Ship Crew Dictionary</h1>
      <p>It is widely known to anyone who has ever worked on a ship, that ship crew have their own language. We come
        from all over the world, from different countries, cultures & languages. However, when we are onboard we are one
        ship, one culture, one crew & one language.</p>
      <p>The objective of this dictionary is to finally centralize all of the great elements of our shared language and
        give it a voice beyond the confines of the crew decks.</p>
